# chinese-reader-macos
Source code for the Chinese Reader for MacOS available at Byzanti.co.uk

2025/08 - Based on a request from a user that emailed me, I've released the source code under MIT.

This code is now very outdated, and should it be rewritten today I would make these main changes:
1. Develop in Swift or even React Native.
2. Use word-splitting functionality that is now available under modern Natural Language Processing libraries instead of doing it myself.
3. Much more organised! This was my first significant Objective-C project.

Enjoy!
